See who _doesn't_ follow you back on **Instagram**

## About

Unfollowers is a tool that allows you to see who doesn't follow you back on Instagram. It's a powerful tool for anyone who wants to grow their following by reaching out to users who are not currently following them.

Our tool works by analyzing your followers and following data from Instagram. We extract the relevant information from the Instagram API and provide you with a list of users who do not follow you back.

With this list, you can easily unfollow these users by clicking the user card and it will take you to their instagram page. By following a more targeted and engaged user base, you can increase your chances of growing your Instagram following.

## Get Started

To start using Unfollowers, simply go to our website and upload your follower data. There's a guide to get follower data on our site. Our tool will then analyze your followers and following data and provide you with the list of users who don't follow you back.

## Developer Info

This tool was built in Next JS App Router + Bun. To start the app locally run the following command:

```bash

```
